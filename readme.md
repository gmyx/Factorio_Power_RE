#Factorio Power Redex

A rebuild of https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Luzivras_Factorio_Power to fix some issue and improve the mod. That mod appears abandonned.

Rebuilt using DRY principals: Don't repeat yourself.

All items have been split into seperate files for the parts: entiry, item, technology, recipe

Original mod was released as GNU GPLv3.

TODO:
* Rebalance (especially boilers) - after initial release
* see if we want to tint water reflections
* Write a migration from old mod - technology names have changed (done)
* add a 'not compatible' to info.json (done)
* write localizations - after initial release
